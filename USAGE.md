# What does this app do?
This app allows you to check the current production status of cars, that were ordered from VW 
Germany and are registered with your VW ID using a "Commission Number".

## What is a VW ID?
A VW ID is the user you use to log into ["My Volkswagen"](https://www.volkswagen.de/myvolkswagen).
Create one if you haven't done so already. Once you've created your VW ID, register your vehicle on
the same website using your commission number.


## What is a commission number?
A commission number is a number that identifies an ordered vehicle before a VIN (vehicle identification
number) is assigned to it. 

## ...and where do I get it?
Ask your dealer for it after ordering a VW vehicle.
